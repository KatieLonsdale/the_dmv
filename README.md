# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. I put the spec and lib file up side by side. I run RSpec on the spec file. If there's a lot of errors, I edit the file to skip some so I am working on one error at a time. If it's just and error or two, I don't worry about skipping.
  For each error, I read the stack trace to see which method, test, and line it is breaking on. I look over at the lib file to find that method and start there. If nothing seems wrong there, I'd move to the other methods that it interacts with or the initialize method.

2. It's hard to follow the logic of what the code is trying to do. It takes some extra time to connect all the dots.

3. I fixed the bugs quicker than I expected. The stack trace was extremely helpful.
